### Live Preview

Quiver supports live preview of Markdown and LaTeX cells. You can switch to Side-by-Side Preview (⌘6) to see the editor and preview side-by-side.

You can also double click on a note in the note list to open it in a new window, then switch to Side-by-Side Preview. You will see something like this:

When you make changes in the editor, the preview is updated as you type.

By default, scrolling is synchronized between the editor and preview. But you can turn this feature off in the View Menu \> Note View \> Scroll Sync.

### Presentation Mode

Quiver also comes with a full-screen presentation mode. You can choose “Start Presentation” (⌃⌥⌘P) from the “Note” menu or click the presentation button at the bottom right corner of the note.

The presentation mode is great for classroom use, team meetings, presentations, or simply reviewing notes on your own.

In the presentation mode, you can use the left/right arrow keys to move to the previous/next note in the list.
